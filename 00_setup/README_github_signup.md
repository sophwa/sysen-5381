## ✅ Your Task: Set Up GitHub

Follow the steps below to get your GitHub account ready for use in this course.

### 🧱 Stage 1: Sign Up for GitHub

- [ ] Go to the 🔗 [Github Signup](https://github.com/signup) page.
- [ ] Check that you went to **`github.com`**, NOT a Github *Enterprise* account like `github.coecis.cornell.edu`. This is **important**!
- [ ] Click "Sign Up" and create a GitHub account.
- [ ] Choose a professional username — ideally your real name or something recognizable.
(Example: My GitHub ID is github.com/timothyfraser)

### 🧱 Stage 2: Customize Your Profile

- [ ] Go to your Github Profile page, located at: `github.com/<your_github_id>`.
- [ ] Customize Your Github Profile to make it easier for people to find you (your classmates, employer, instructors, etc.).
    - [ ] Click **Edit Profile** to customize your 'Name' and Profile Picture on Github, so you are easier to search for. 
    - [ ] Set your name to your professional name. For example, mine is **Timothy Fraser, PhD.**
    - [ ] Set your profile picture to something recognizable - either your **professional headshot** or a **cute animal**, or *something*. Do NOT keep the default Github profile pictures - millions of users use it. Having a distinctive photo will help a lot.
