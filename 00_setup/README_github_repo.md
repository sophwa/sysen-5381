# Activity: Create a GitHub Repository 

*Estimated Time: 10 minutes*

---

In this exercise, you are asked to complete the following steps to make a GitHub repository, and include a screenshot of each step in your response in the Canvas text box.

Just one repository per person is fine, but you are welcome to make more repositories if helpful.

## Tasks

- [ ] List your GitHub ID. 
   - If you didn't make a GitHub ID at the beginning of this class, please return to Activity: Setup account with PositCloud and follow the steps to create a GitHub Account and link it to Posit Cloud.
- [ ] Create a GitHub Repository, following the steps in our readings this week. Give it a simple name, preferably all lowercase with no spaces.
- [ ] Find the URL of your GitHub Repository.
- [ ] Add one group member to your GitHub Repository. 
- [ ] On GitHub, go to Settings/Collaborators and click to add a new member to the repository. 
- [ ] Supply your group member's GitHub ID. If for some reason you are unable to connect with a group member to obtain their GitHub ID, you can use mine and share the repository with me, to test it out. My ID is `timothyfraser`.
- [ ] Take a screenshot of the collaborators page after adding a member. You do not need to wait until the member has accepted the invite.


## To Submit

- [ ] Take screenshots of each step and paste them in the CANVAS text submission box for this activity.
