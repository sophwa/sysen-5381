## Overview

Lunar New Year is a family-centered new year festival celebrated across many East and Southeast Asian cultures, aligned with the lunar or lunisolar calendar rather than the Gregorian calendar. It marks a transition from the old year to the new and emphasizes renewal, good fortune, and community.

Different cultures have their own names and customs for the holiday, such as Spring Festival in mainland China, Seollal in Korea, and Tết in Vietnam. While details vary, common themes include returning home, honoring ancestors, sharing festive meals, and expressing hopes for luck and prosperity in the coming year.

## Key Dates & Calendar

- **Calendar basis:** The holiday follows a lunar or lunisolar calendar, so the date shifts each year in the Gregorian calendar, typically falling between late January and mid-February.
- **Eve and main day:** Celebrations usually begin on Lunar New Year’s Eve with a family reunion dinner and continue on Lunar New Year’s Day with visits, greetings, and rituals.
- **Length of celebration:** In some traditions (e.g., Spring Festival), the period of observance can extend for 15 days, ending with the Lantern Festival; in others, the main focus is on the first 3 days.
- **Zodiac cycle:** Many communities associate each year with an animal in the zodiac cycle, shaping decorations, greetings, and symbolic meanings for that year.

## Core Traditions

- **Family reunion:** Extended families gather, often with members traveling long distances to return to their hometowns for a shared meal and time together.
- **Ancestor respect:** Many households honor ancestors with offerings at home altars or gravesites, expressing gratitude and seeking blessings.
- **Cleaning and preparation:** Homes are cleaned before the new year to symbolically sweep out bad luck, then decorated with auspicious colors (often red and gold) and symbols.
- **Festive meals:** Special dishes symbolize wishes for the new year, such as abundance, longevity, unity, or prosperity, depending on local traditions.
- **Gifts and envelopes:** It is common to give money in red envelopes or other symbolic gifts, especially to children and younger relatives, as a gesture of good fortune and care.
- **Greetings and well-wishes:** People exchange new year greetings that invoke health, happiness, and prosperity, often using culturally specific phrases and forms of address.

## Regional Variations (High-Level)

- **Korean communities (Seollal):** Families wear traditional clothing, perform ancestral rites (charye), eat rice cake soup, and younger family members bow to elders in a formal new year’s greeting.
- **Vietnamese communities (Tết):** Celebrations often center on family visits, altar offerings, and symbolic foods like sticky rice cakes, with strong attention to first-footing and auspicious beginnings.
- **Diaspora communities:** Practices may blend traditions from multiple cultures and adapt to local contexts, while still emphasizing reunion, remembrance, and renewal.

## Contemporary Considerations

- **Travel and logistics:** In some regions, holiday travel creates one of the largest annual human migrations, affecting transport systems and work schedules.
- **Public holidays:** Many countries and regions designate several days of official holidays around Lunar New Year, while others may observe it primarily within communities and households.
- **Inclusivity and naming:** When engaging with diverse groups, it is helpful to recognize that “Lunar New Year” includes multiple cultural observances, each with its own preferred names and specific customs.
