## What is **DigitalOcean**?

> **DigitalOcean** is a cloud infrastructure hosting company. It allows you to rent virtual machines and servers, deploy apps, and much, much more. Compared to other options (eg. **Amazon Web Services** or **Google Cloud Platform**) **DigitalOcean** is streamlined and has ***very, very clear pricing.*** We use DigitalOcean as a realistic example of deployment services - good for teaching and also for real use.

## What to Expect

- You can expect to pay $5 a month for the smallest kind of live app deployment.
- You can archive projects to stop paying for them, and then unarchive them later to redeploy when needed.
- Think of this as part of a course's usual textbook fee.
- You will need a **form of online payment** to subscribe. See details below.

## For Future Reference

When you deploy an app with your firm in the future, shop around! Compare options. Cloud infrastructure vendors are always competing.

Some good places to start:

| Vendor | Value-Added | Supported Apps |
